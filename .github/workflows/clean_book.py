'''
Not to be confused with ensure_clean_notebooks.py, this program scans
all jupyter notebooks in the repository and clears cells marked as student
response sections, removing the code so that the students might implement
it themselves. If you accidentally run this on the teacher version of the
curriculum book, just run `git restore book` to revert local changes.
