# Summary

The "Machine Learning in the Geosciences" course, offered as ESS 469/569 at the University of Washington since 2023 and up the time of publication, introduces both undergraduate and graduate students to the application of machine learning (ML) techniques within geoscientific contexts. 

# Statement of need 

Machine learning (ML) has rapidly emerged as a transformative tool in the analysis of big data and scientific discovery across disciplines, especially since 2010. Geosciences, with its inherently large, complex, and multidimensional datasets, is particularly poised to benefit from ML's capabilities [@bergen2019, ]. Yet, despite the explosion of ML applications in geoscientific research, there is no established curriculum in higher education that focuses on equipping students with practical ML skills tailored to the unique needs of geosciences.  

While data science courses have recently gained traction, they typically provide general-purpose training that lacks the domain-specific emphasis critical for addressing the challenges of geoscientific datasets, such as handling spatiotemporal structures, geospatial data formats, and the integration of physical constraints into ML models. A course dedicated specifically to ML in geosciences bridges this gap, ensuring students and researchers gain the expertise to tackle pressing environmental and Earth system challenges through AI-driven approaches.  

The **JupyterBook** created for this course is particularly timely. Geoscience programs across institutions are increasingly recognizing the critical importance of AI and ML research. However, these programs often lack the resources or infrastructure to independently develop practical, cutting-edge ML curricula. This JupyterBook provides an accessible, open-source, and modular framework that can be immediately integrated into academic programs, accelerating the adoption of AI technologies within geoscientific education and research.  

By offering hands-on, practical experience with ML techniques using geoscientific examples, this course ensures that students not only understand ML concepts but can also directly apply them to real-world problems. This foundational training is vital for preparing the next generation of geoscientists to leverage AI for critical discoveries, from climate change mitigation to natural hazard forecasting and resource exploration.  

In summary, this course addresses a growing need in higher education by filling a critical gap in geoscientific training. It equips students with ML expertise, fosters interdisciplinary innovation, and ensures geoscientific programs remain at the forefront of scientific discovery in the era of AI.


## The Story

The MLGEO course arose from merging a development course "Data Sciences in the Earth and Planetary Sciences" (2021) and the NSF funded Geosmart project [@Cristea2024]. The course became a senior undergraduate and graduate level course designed for students at the University of Washington primarily enrolled in Earth and Space Sciences, Atmospheric and Climate Sciences, Oceanography, Forestry, Fisheries, Civil Environmental Engineering, programs that focus on domain-specific science typically with vast amount of data and needed a practicum in machine learning. The course was reviewed by colleagues in applied mathematics and computer sciences program to differentiate between "applied machine learning" and "fundamental machine learning" in 2023. The course is now offered yearly and enrolls 35-40 students.



**Course Structure:**

1. **AI-ready GeoData:** Focuses on geoscientific data modalities, characteristics, feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and preparing datasets for AI applications.

2. **Classic Machine Learning:** Covers model training, evaluation, and robust training practices for algorithms such as K-means, random forests, and k-nearest neighbors.

3. **Deep Learning:** Explores foundational concepts including fully connected layers, convolutional neural networks, sequence-to-sequence learning with recurrent neural networks, and modern topics like physics-informed neural networks and network architecture search.

**Learning Objectives:**

By the end of the course, students are expected to:

- Demonstrate proficiency in Python programming, Jupyter notebooks, Git version control, and deploying scripts on various computing platforms.

- Develop and apply standard ML workflows, including data preparation, model design, training, validation, and evaluation.

- Implement data manipulation strategies pertinent to geosciences, such as handling time series and geospatial data, data visualization, dimensionality reduction, and feature engineering.

- Understand and apply open science principles, ensuring reproducibility and adherence to digital scholarship standards.

- Gain familiarity with canonical examples across various geoscience disciplines.

- Comprehend advanced techniques like Fourier and wavelet transforms, principal component analysis, and their applications in data interpretation.

**Technical Skills Development:**

The course emphasizes building competencies in:

- **Shell scripting**

- **Version control with Git and GitHub**

- **Python programming**, utilizing packages such as NumPy, (Geo)Pandas, scikit-learn, Keras, and PyTorch

- **Data visualization** using Matplotlib and Plotly

- **High-performance computing** strategies

**Prerequisites:**

Students should have completed courses in mathematics (MATH 207 and MATH 208, or equivalents) and possess some programming experience (e.g., CS160 or CS163). While prior knowledge of Python is recommended, the course provides refreshers on computing as needed.
