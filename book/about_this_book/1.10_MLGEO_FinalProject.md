# UW MLGEO class final project


The UW MLGEO class that is developing this book. The course is project-based with a progression throughout the curriculum. The project should reflect the 3 pillars of the course: AI-ready data set, Classic ML, and Deep Learning. The deliverables at the end are:
* A Github Repository that demonstrate data manipulation, algorithm design and testing, and evaluation.
* A 5-page report to place the project into a scientific context and provide scientific discussion about the results.
* A 15-min presentation.

The groups submit each deliverable together. The course encourage the use of ChatGPT to self-evaluate and make progress.

The rubric for the final project follow below useful for self-evaluation and instructor's evaluation.
