### Lecture: How to Develop and Use a Pandas Lambda Function for Geoscientific Data Analysis

**1. Introduction to Lambda Functions in Python:**
- **Lambda functions** are small, anonymous functions in Python.
- They are used for quick, simple operations without needing to define a full function using `def`.
- In geoscience, where we deal with large datasets (e.g., climate data, seismic measurements), lambda functions allow us to process data efficiently.

Example:
```python
lambda x: x * 1.2
```
This lambda function multiplies any input `x` by 1.2, which could be useful for tasks like converting units (e.g., from inches to centimeters).

**2. Why Use Lambda Functions in Pandas for Geoscience?**
- Geoscientific datasets often contain large volumes of environmental or geological measurements stored in **Pandas DataFrames** (e.g., time series data, spatial data).
- Lambda functions in Pandas allow you to quickly transform, filter, or process this data with minimal code.
  
### **3. Using Lambda with Pandas: Geoscience Example**

#### Example 1: Applying a Lambda Function to Temperature Data
Imagine you have a dataset containing temperature readings in Fahrenheit, and you want to convert them to Celsius.

**Scenario:** You have a column `Temperature_F` with temperature values in Fahrenheit.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample DataFrame
data = {'Temperature_F': [32, 50, 77, 100]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius
df['Temperature_C'] = df['Temperature_F'].apply(lambda x: (x - 32) * 5 / 9)

print(df)
```

**Output:**
```
   Temperature_F  Temperature_C
0             32       0.000000
1             50      10.000000
2             77      25.000000
3            100      37.777778
```

Here, the lambda function `lambda x: (x - 32) * 5 / 9` converts Fahrenheit to Celsius for each value in the `Temperature_F` column.

#### Example 2: Conditional Logic for Earthquake Magnitude Data
You can use lambda functions to add conditional logic, such as classifying earthquake magnitudes into categories.

**Scenario:** You have a column `Magnitude` containing seismic event magnitudes, and you want to classify events as "Minor", "Moderate", or "Severe".

```python
data = {'Magnitude': [2.5, 4.2, 6.0, 7.5]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Classify earthquake magnitudes
df['Category'] = df['Magnitude'].apply(lambda x: 'Minor' if x < 4.0 else ('Moderate' if x < 6.5 else 'Severe'))

print(df)
```

**Output:**
```
   Magnitude   Category
0        2.5      Minor
1        4.2   Moderate
2        6.0   Moderate
3        7.5     Severe
```

The lambda function `lambda x: 'Minor' if x < 4.0 else ('Moderate' if x < 6.5 else 'Severe')` classifies earthquake magnitudes based on their values.

### **4. Lambda with Multiple Columns: Analyzing Precipitation Data**

You can also apply lambda functions to work with multiple columns, which is common in geoscientific datasets, where you might have spatial or temporal data.

#### Example 3: Calculating an Index Based on Multiple Measurements
**Scenario:** You have rainfall (`Rainfall_mm`) and evaporation (`Evaporation_mm`) data, and you want to calculate the **Net Water Balance** for each record.

```python
data = {'Rainfall_mm': [100, 80, 120], 'Evaporation_mm': [60, 70, 65]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate Net Water Balance
df['Net_Water_Balance'] = df.apply(lambda row: row['Rainfall_mm'] - row['Evaporation_mm'], axis=1)

print(df)
```

**Output:**
```
   Rainfall_mm  Evaporation_mm  Net_Water_Balance
0          100              60                 40
1           80              70                 10
2          120              65                 55
```

In this example, `lambda row: row['Rainfall_mm'] - row['Evaporation_mm']` calculates the net water balance by subtracting evaporation from rainfall for each record.

### **5. Advanced: Time Series Data Manipulation with Lambda Functions**

Geoscientists frequently work with time series data (e.g., climate data). Lambda functions can be used for efficient data transformations within time series.

#### Example 4: Applying a Rolling Window Calculation
**Scenario:** Suppose you have daily temperature data, and you want to calculate a 7-day rolling average.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample daily temperature data
data = {'Date': pd.date_range(start='2023-09-01', periods=10, freq='D'),
        'Temperature_C': [20, 22, 23, 21, 19, 24, 25, 26, 22, 20]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate 7-day rolling average using lambda
df['7_day_avg'] = df['Temperature_C'].rolling(window=7).apply(lambda x: x.mean())

print(df)
```

**Output:**
```
        Date  Temperature_C  7_day_avg
0 2023-09-01             20        NaN
1 2023-09-02             22        NaN
2 2023-09-03             23        NaN
3 2023-09-04             21        NaN
4 2023-09-05             19        NaN
5 2023-09-06             24        NaN
6 2023-09-07             25  22.000000
7 2023-09-08             26  22.857143
8 2023-09-09             22  23.142857
9 2023-09-10             20  22.714286
```

Here, `lambda x: x.mean()` calculates the rolling mean over a 7-day window for temperature data, which is essential in climate analysis for smoothing short-term fluctuations.
