# 3.2 General Frameworks for Training Machine Learning Models

Different learning paradigms cater to various types of data and problem settings. This chapter explores the general frameworks for training models, focusing on unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, self-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Understanding these frameworks will equip you with the knowledge to select the most suitable approach for your geoscientific research.

## 1. Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning involves training models on datasets without labeled outputs. The goal is to uncover hidden patterns, structures, or features within the data. Unlike supervised learning, there are no explicit target variables to guide the learning process.

### Key Techniques

* **Clustering**: Groups similar data points based on feature similarity.
    * **Examples**: K-means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN.
* **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduces the number of features while preserving essential information.
    * **Examples**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE).
* **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies data points that deviate significantly from the norm.
    * **Examples**: Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM.

Examples in geosciences might be geochemical anomaly detection to Identifying areas with unusual mineral concentrations (REF); seismic facies analysis to grouping seismic data to interpret subsurface geological structures (REF), or climate pattern discovery by Uncovering patterns in climate data to understand atmospheric phenomena (REF).

### Advantages and Challenges

| Advantages | Challenges |
|------------|------------|
| No need for labeled data, which can be costly or impractical to obtain. | Interpretation of results can be subjective. |
| Useful for exploratory data analysis. | Model evaluation is less straightforward due to the absence of ground truth. |

## 2. Semi-Supervised Learning

Semi-supervised learning combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data during training. It leverages the unlabeled data to improve model performance, especially when obtaining labels is expensive or time-consuming.

### Key Approaches

* **Self-Training**: The model is initially trained on labeled data, then used to predict labels for unlabeled data, which are added to the training set iteratively.
* **Co-Training**: Two or more models are trained on different subsets or views of the data, each helping to label the unlabeled data for the other.
* **Graph-Based Methods**: Use graph structures to represent data points and propagate labels through connections.

6.2.3 Applications in Geosciences

	•	Land Cover Mapping: Enhancing classification accuracy when only a few ground truth samples are available.
	•	Mineral Prospectivity Modeling: Utilizing abundant unlabeled geophysical data with limited labeled samples.
	•	Environmental Hazard Prediction: Improving models for predicting events like landslides or floods with scarce labeled incidents.


| Advantages                                      | Challenges                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Improves model accuracy with less labeled data. | Risk of propagating incorrect labels.                        |
| Cost-effective when labeling is expensive.      | Model performance heavily depends on the quality of the initial labeled dataset. |

## 3. Self-Supervised Learning

Self-supervised learning is a subset of unsupervised learning where the data itself provides the supervision. Models are trained to predict parts of the data from other parts, creating surrogate tasks that generate labels from the data’s structure.

### Key Concepts

* **Pretext Tasks**: Artificial tasks designed to train models on inherent data structures.
    * *8Examples**: Predicting missing data, solving jigsaw puzzles with image patches, temporal order verification.
* **Representation Learning**: The model learns meaningful representations that can be transferred to downstream tasks.


	•	Remote Sensing Imagery: Learning features by predicting rotations or transformations applied to satellite images.
	•	Seismic Data Completion: Training models to reconstruct missing portions of seismic signals.
	•	Time-Series Forecasting: Predicting future geophysical measurements based on past data patterns.

| Advantages                                      | Challenges                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Utilizes vast amounts of unlabeled data.        | Designing effective pretext tasks can be non-trivial.        |
| Produces robust feature representations.        | The learned representations may not always transfer well to specific tasks. |

# 4 Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a learning paradigm where an agent interacts with an environment to achieve a goal. The agent learns to make decisions by performing actions and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.
